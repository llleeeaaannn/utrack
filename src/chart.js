// Aim: The graph should plot the count of users that remain after the filters, bucketed by their month of birth (the "monthly" line). A second line (labelled "cumulative" in the diagram above) should show the accumulated cost over the course of the year if every one of those users was given (and redeemed) a $5 discount. So if the "monthly" line was plotted at 10 and 12 for January and February, for example, the "cumulative" line would be plotted at $50 and $110 (22 Ã— $5).

// So users line shows how many users are left in that month (after filtering)
// Cumulative spend line shows the cumulative cost of the discounts

// X axis is just the months

// Potentially have 2 y axis (left + right) for clearer reading as cumilative values should be much higher

  const monthlyUsers = Array(12).fill(0);
  users.forEach(user => monthlyUsers[user.birthday - 1]++);

  let runningTotal = 0

    runningTotal = runningTotal + (monthlyUsers[i] * 5)
